<h1>So what's really going on here?</h1>

<p>So you may be wondering, wtf is this? or maybe even, Where I've been if you know me.</p>


<p>Well, to start with, welcome to my site. I've decided to make it not just from an ideological point, which is that everyone should plant their flag on the internet, but also to have a place where I can just talk about things however I wish.</p>
<p>So essentially, I'll share some of my opinions and overall just be my true uncensored self.</p>
<p>If you're interested in Niche electronics/software, Vintage computing, Free Software with the occasional political rant that would get r/Jordan to wanna kill me and Car stuff, Then you may actually want to check in here every now and then :3</p>

<p>As for the tiny few who were wondering where I've gone, It's a lil thing called life and it's a bitch.</p>

<p>PS: If you're one of the losers stalking me since my old Reddit days, genuinely get a fucking life <3 </p>
